# the-wiry-take-home-assessment

Hello! If you are reading this then we're likely in the process chatting with you about a technical role at The Wiry. If so, congratulations ðŸŽ‰ !

In order to move forward, we'd like to know a little about how you work. To that end, this repository contains an exercise that you can use demonstrate your skills and abilities.

The goal of these exercises is to give you an asynchronous medium for demonstrating how you would break down a set of user stories and requirements into a working code. 

## Design Brief

The goal of this is to build a single route backend infrastructure for the wiry prototype webpage. For the context of 
this assessment, lets assume we are attempting to build a real-time delivery system and providing everyone an 
opportunity to earn and provide much more convenience. We will be breaking down the assessment to various milestones for us 
to be able to evaluate the progress and grade.

### Business Needs

- A customer is able to place an order through our order landing page and get a tracking number. Evaluation is based on
intuitiveness, time spent to place the order and ofcourse the execution :)
- A customer is able to track the order/s. Please keep in mind that conveying appropriate error messages do count towards extra points.

#### Milestones

Milestone #1 
 
 Design a backend database that caters to the business needs of order placement. The design should be extensible to future features.

Milestone #2
 
 Expose an API to interact with UI endpoints (eg., /get_order_status/<order_id>)
 
Milestone #3

 Wire the API and UI endpoints for an end to end order placement and retrieval path.
